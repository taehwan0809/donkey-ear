### *A Student Suggestion Box System Inspired by the Korean Folktale “임금님 귀는 당나귀 귀”*

A full-stack suggestion platform where students can anonymously express their thoughts—just like shouting into the well from the old Korean tale—while administrators can review and respond.

This system promotes safe and structured communication between students and teachers.
